# Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide

## Section 1: What is Ethereum?

### A Short History of Ethereum

- "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" written and released by Satoshi Nakamoto on October 31, 2008.
- Only purpose of bitcoin is to enable financial transactions, sending money from Person A to Person B.
- People started expanding the idea of transferring currencies to other types of exchanges as well.
- "Ethereum: The Ultimate Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform" released by Vitalik Buterin on December 2013.
- Introduces the idea of 'Smart Contracts' as an entity that can send and receive currency, beyond just humans.
- Smart Contracts are operated on a blockchain network which can be used to create more advanced applications.

### What is Ethereum?

- There are Ethereum networks which are used to transfer money and store data.
- There are many different Ethereum networks.
- Each Ethereum network consists of one or more nodes.
- Each node in an Ethereum network is a machine running an ethereum client.
- Anyone can run a node in the network.
- Each node can contain a full copy of the blockchain.
- The 'Blockchain' is a database that stores a record of every transaction that has ever taken place.



## Section 2: Smart Contracts with Solidity
- Rinkeby Network contains Infura node.
- Infura API is a public API which provides access to Infura node which is hosted by Rinkeby Network.
